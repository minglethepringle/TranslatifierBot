# TranslatifierBot
A Reddit copypasta bot with the power of Google Translate.

Hosted on Heroku and resides on [/r/copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta). Under the Reddit user [/u/TranslatifierBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/TranslatifierBot/).

Idea taken from ["Let It Go" from Frozen according to Google Translate (PARODY)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bVAoVlFYf0)

### Process
- When a new submission is posted, the script reads the body of the copypasta post
- The script iterates through a loop a random number of times and translates the post body to a random language from an array
- It ends with a translation back to English and a reply to the comment.
